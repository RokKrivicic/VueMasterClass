# Vue Master Class

# Notes

Used jest dom library 5.17.0 to have decribe, it, expect, ... available from the setup file.
The implementation with higher version 6.1.3 would not make those method automatically available.
They would still work, but no completion was present (Also mentiond in the course section 7, video 63)
